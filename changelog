      [ Oleh Dmytrychenko <dmytrychenko.oleh@gmail.com> github: @NitrogenUA ]
    - Support for getting Let's Encrypt cert via IPv6 - closes #1785.
    - Refactor network interface code to ensure that it works as expected and
      supports more possible network config (e.g. hotplug interfaces & wifi).

    - Bugfix exception when quitting configuration of mail relay.
      [ Oleh Dmytrychenko <dmytrychenko.oleh@gmail.com> github: @NitrogenUA ]
    - Improve code quality: implement typing, fstrings and make (mostly) PEP8
      compliant.
      [Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> & Jeremy Davis

  * Firstboot Initialization (inithooks):
    - Refactor start up (now hooks into getty process, rather than having it's
      own service).
      [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]
    - Refactor firstboot.d/01ipconfig (and 09hostname) to ensure that hostname
      is included in dhcp info when set via inithooks.
    - Package turnkey-make-ssl-cert script (from common overlay - now packaged
      as turnkey-ssl). Refactor relevant scripts to leverage turnkey-ssl.
    - Refactor run script - use bashisms and general tidying.
    - Show blacklisted password characters more nicely.
    - Misc packaging changes/improvements.
    - Support returning output from MySQL - i.e. support 'SELECT'. (Only
      applies to apps that include MySQL/MariaDB).

    - Removed stunnel reverse proxy (Webmin hosted directly now).
    - Ensure that Webmin uses HTTPS with default cert
      (/etc/ssl/private/cert.pem).
    - Disabled Webmin Let's Encrypt (for now).

  * Web shell (shellinabox):
    - Completely removed in v18.0 (Webmin now has a proper interactive shell).

  * Backup (tklbam):
    - Ported dependencies to Debian Bookworm; otherwise unchanged.

  * Security hardening & improvements:
    - Generate and use new TurnKey Bookworm keys.
    - Automate (and require) default pinning for packages from Debian
      backports. Also support non-free backports.

  * Misc bugfixes & feature implementations:
    - Remove rsyslog package (systemd journal now all that's needed).
    - Include zstd compression support.
    - Enable new non-free-firmware apt repo by default.
    - Improve turnkey-artisan so that it works reliably in cron jobs (only
      Laravel based LAMP apps).

  * TKLDev specific updates/tweaks below:

  * fab:
    - Improve typing and implemnt fstrings.
    - Improved code styling (mostly PEP8 compliant now).
    - Support debug logging via '-d|--debug' switch.
    [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> & Jeremy Davis ]

    - Update to streamline build process - add install target to install
      bootstrap into tkldev.

    - add lsb_release as bootstrap dependency.
    [ Stefan Davis <stefan@turnkeylinux.org> ]

turnkey-tkldev-17.2 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Rebuild to include latest fab (v1.0.2) improvements/bugfixes.

  * Add preliminary support for Raspberry Pi. (Much more work required to
    complete this - but it's a start).
    [Yannick Heneault <https://github.com/heneault>]

  * Updated all Debian packages to latest.
    [ autopatched by buildtasks ]

  * Patched bugfix release. Closes #1734.
    [ autopatched by buildtasks ]

 -- Jeremy Davis <jeremy@turnkeylinux.org>  Tue, 12 May 2022 01:41:55 +0000

turnkey-tkldev-17.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Upgraded base distribution to Debian 11.1/Bullseye.

  * caching proxy:

    - Switch from Polipo (only cached http and is no longer available in
      Debian) to Squid. Squid is configured as a caching http/https proxy.
      Using 'squid-openssl' package, it is configured to act as a MITM (man in
      the middle) caching proxy - closes #1560.

  * fab:

    - Port code to python3 and major code refactoring.
    - Use new 'turnkey-chroot' library for use in 'fab-chroot'.
    - Use xorriso (instead of genisoimage) for generating ISO. This provides
      UEFI boot support (note this only supports booting the ISO via UEFI;
      additional work in di-live required to complete UEFI install support).
      Part of #1435.
      NOTE: The UEFI support started for v17.0 di-live and ISO builds has been
      (temporarily) rolled back and won't be implemented in v17.0.

  * pool:

    - Port code to python3 and major code refactoring. Closes #1272.
    - (Still not pre-installed by default).

  * bootstrap:

    - Include 'ca-certificates' package (to support https apt repos via squid
      https proxy).

  * corestrap:

    - Support the option of using a "corestrap", rather than a minimalist
      bootstrap. A corestrap is a bootstrap, but with all core packages
      (except the kernel) pre-installed. It is larger than the bootstrap, but
      speeds up builds significantly.

  * Note: Please refer to turnkey-core's 17.0 changelog for changes common to
    all appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.

turnkey-tkldev-16.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * No longer include pool, chanko and friends by default. tkldev-chanko-setup
    script has been tweaked and some config setup has been moved to package
    postinst scripts.

    TODO: more work is still required to make it possible for users to easily
          build packages. Plus the buildroot repo needs update.

  * fab:

    - major changes to way that the bootstrap is built. Now leverages Debian's
      debootstrap directly (bootstrap components removed from fab, remaining
      changes in turnkey/bootstrap repo).

  * buildtasks:

    - significant refactoring, including inclusion of bt-bootstrap script to
      build bootstrap if relevant bootstrap not currently available.
    - updates to most bt- scripts for Buster.
    - refactoring of bin/signature-verify to support forcing check of hashfile
      GPG signing via '--force-gpg' switch (default behaviour remains unsigned
      files just giving warning).

  * tkldev-setup:

    - refactor to give more meaningful output.
    - change order of repo cloning (now 1st) & bootstrap download (now 2nd).
    - leverage buildtasks/config/common.cfg (fallback to config.example if not
      setup) to set relevant GPG key ID (BT_GPGKEY).
    - leverage buildtasks/bin/signature-verify script to check downloaded
      bootstrap file.

  * Docs:

    - additional development docs now included in build code repo (none
      included in built appliance by default; yet).
    - many docs rewritten and/or improved.
    - many docs still outdated and/or in need of improvement. :(

    appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.
